# COVID-19 Tracker App

This project is built to show case live tracking of **COVID-19** cases worldwide.\
It represents live data of the current _infection rate_, _recovery rate_, _total patients recovered_ and _total deaths_.\
**Dynamic bar graphs** are used to study the data. A **map** is provided which shows different zones.

---
ðŸŸ¢**Green zones**ðŸŸ¢ denote the number of cases recovered in that region whereas\
ðŸ”´**Red zones**ðŸ”´ denote the infection rate and deaths in that particular region. 

Clicking on any country in the map will show data specific to that region.
